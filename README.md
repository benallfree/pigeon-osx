# Freelancer Pomodoro Timer

## Introduction

This OS X menu utility is a Pomodoro style timer meant for freelancers who are juggling several clients and tasks
among clients. Use it with Pomodoro-style time management when
multiple clients and activities are mixed.

## Features

* Pop up a "What are you doing?" reminder at set interval (default 10 minutes)
* Activate, Deactivate, or Snooze timer
* Support for multiple client names
* Rememebers previously typed memos
* Export CSV report of activity for easy updates to clients

## Installation

To install, you can visit the app store...just kidding. You need XCode right now. Good luck with that.

## Usage

Run the app and a little clock icon will appear in your menu. When it's running, it's red. When it's stopped, it's black. Every so often, it will pop up a window asking what you are currently doing.
